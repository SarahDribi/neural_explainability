Day 4 — Metrics that matter + aggregator
Define a standard results schema (stable keys).

Add script scripts/aggregate_results.sh (or .py) → summary.csv across runs.

Compute at least:

nap_size_before, nap_size_after, remaining_pct

proved_standard (optional if available), proved_exclusive, timeouts

time_fullnap_s, time_mincert_s (if you run both), or at least time_s

epsilon_exclusive

Add one plot script (optional): time vs remaining %.

Acceptance criteria
python scripts/aggregate.py experiments > summary.csv works; CSV has ≥ the fields above
