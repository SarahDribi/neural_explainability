first clean the code 
train another model (more big )
rerun the same script 
undertand how branch and bound choses the neurons
write the heuristic where we chose the the derivative of  the activation logit with respect to neuron s preactivation value
think about a way to ground it 
train it on tabular data (chose the dataset and see how it s going )
clean the code 
write and clean unit tests 
add the coarsening outcomes as metrics
read the deep learning pdf I sent myself 
learn more about optimization 

# think abou classes to be written cleanely 
# how can I incorporate other papers and actually write a mini paper
# neatly rebrand all 
# Save the pictures like alessandro said   (urgent)
# exploit the lime framework  why should i trust you ? 
# how can it be parrallazied
# can i change the branch and bound constraints ?
# I need to make sure the advanced metrics run well 

# How can I GRound the explanations ?
# entrainer un petit mod√®le mnist et verifier qu il est verification friendly
# en comparant ses rayons de robustness par rapport au petit network
